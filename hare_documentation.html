HARE DOCUMENTATION:

Info ya need to know beforehand:
- Press RUN to iterate a program. Pressing RUN will not reset any values.
- Press RESET to actually reset values.
- All sequences end with a period (.)
- You can have multiple functions within a sequence. This could come in useful when dealing with INIT or IF/REPEAT/UNLESS keywords. 
	- Ex. PEN DOWN MOVE 10 TURN 15 PEN UP.
- Numbers can be either numbers, variables, or expressions (any expression in JS will work as of now, will likely change this soon)
- All variables are floating point
- The canvas is 256 x 256
- Pointer location can be accessed with px and py
- You do not need to have quotation marks when inputting strings or variable names.

INIT (sequence)
- Any sequence with an INIT before it will only run on the first iteration.

MOVE [number]
- Moves the pointer by that amount of pixels.

TURN [number in degrees]
- Turns the pointer by that many degrees.

PEN
- Controls various aspects about the pen
	- PEN UP: Stops drawing
	- PEN DOWN: Starts drawing
	- PEN WHITE: Pen erases instead
	- PEN BLACK: Pen writes as usual
	- PEN [number] adjusts width of pen

GOTO [x, y]
- Goes to a point defined by the coordinates

ANGLE [number in degrees]
- Orients the pointer to a fixed rotation in degrees.

RESET
- Restarts the program. Sets iterations to 0 and reinitializes all values.

CLEAR
- Clears the screen.

VAR [variable name, number]
- Defines a variable, or sets it to a certain value.
- Variables should be ideally not too long and be in letters only.

INC [variable name, number]
- Increments a variable by a certain amount. (Use negative numbers to decrement)
- see VAR for more info.

GET [variable name]
- Prints out the current value of a variable. Mainly used for debugging purposes.

HELP
- Does nothing, since asking for help is bad for the environment as we all know

IF [number] [comparison] [number]
- If the comparison is true, the nearest sequence preceded by a THEN is executed.

UNLESS [number] [comparison] [number]
- If the comparison is false, the nearest sequence preceded by a THEN is executed.

REPEAT [number]
- Repeats the nearest sequence preceded by a THEN is executed.

*Currently, IF, UNLESS, and REPEAT statements cannot be nested.

THEN (statement)
- Searches for the nearest IF, UNLESS, or REPEAT, and does stuff accordingly.

PRINT [text]
- Prints text.

PRINTMAFS [number]
- Prints a number.

WAIT [number]
- Waits for that amount of milliseconds. Currently very buggy.
