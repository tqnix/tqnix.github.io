<br>HARE DOCUMENTATION:
<br>
<br>Info ya need to know beforehand:
<br>- Press RUN to iterate a program. Pressing RUN will not reset any values.
<br>- Alternatively, you can use the auto-iterate function to have a program automatically iterate over and over based on a fixed amount of time.
<br>- Press RESET to reset all values
<br>- All sequences end with a period (.) by default.
<br>- You can have multiple functions within a sequence. This could come in useful when using the INIT or THEN functions, or when defining a function with DEF.
<br>	- Ex. PEN DOWN MOVE 10 TURN 15 PEN UP.
<br>- Functions with numerical parameters accept numbers, variables, or expressions enclosed in brackets.
<br>- because the period is used for ending a sequence, you need to express non-integer numbers using fractions (i. e. 0.47 can be represented as 47/100).
<br>- All variables are floating point numbers.
<br>- The canvas is 256 x 256 with a gray background.
<br>- You do not need to have quotation marks when inputting variable or function names.
<br>- Simple (supported by JS) mathematical expressions can be entered in place of numbers by having the expression in parantheses.
<br>
<br><h1>VARIABLES</h1>
<br>
<br>px: pen x position
<br>py: pen y position
<br>pd: pen angle (in degrees)
<br>random: random number from 0 to 1
<br>randominteger: random integer from 0 to 99 (inclusive)
<br>randomangle: random integer from 0 to 359 (inclusive)
<br>
<br><h1>MATH SHORTHAND</h1>
<br>
<br>These can be used in place of JS math operations, because many math functions can't be entered without a period.
<br>You need to have parenthesis after the shorthand because the shorthand only stands in for the characters, not the parentheses.
<br>Here is a list of the shorthand usable in Hare and their JS equivalent, or what they do:
<br>
<br>#sin: Math.sin
<br>#cos: Math.cos
<br>#tan: Math.tan
<br>#asin: Math.asin
<br>#acos: Math.acos
<br>#atan: Math.atan
<br>#ceil: Math.ceil
<br>#floor: Math.floor
<br>#min: Math.min
<br>#max: Math.max
<br>#ln: Math.log
<br>#log: Math.log10
<br>#pi: Math.PI
<br>#sqrt: Math.sqrt
<br>#deg: A function that converts from radians to degrees
<br>#abs: Math.abs
<br>
<br><h1>FUNCTIONS</h1>
<br>
<br>INIT (sequence)
<br>- Any sequence with an INIT before it will only run on the first iteration.
<br>
<br>MOVE [number]
<br>- Moves the pointer by that amount of pixels.
<br>
<br>TURN [number in degrees]
<br>- Turns the pointer by that many degrees.
<br>
<br>PEN
<br>- Controls various aspects about the pen
<br>	- PEN UP: Stops drawing
<br>	- PEN DOWN: Starts drawing
<br>  - PEN TOGGLE: Toggles between pen up and down
<br>	- PEN [number] adjusts width of pen
<br>
<br>GOTO [x, y]
<br>- Goes to a point defined by the coordinates
<br>
<br>ANGLE [number in degrees]
<br>- Orients the pointer to a fixed rotation in degrees.
<br>
<br>RESET
<br>- Restarts the program. Sets iterations to 0 and reinitializes all values.
<br>
<br>CLEAR
<br>- Clears the screen.
<br>
<br>CLEAROUTPUT
<br>- Clears the debug output at the bottom.
<br>
<br>VAR [variable name, number]
<br>- Defines a variable, or sets it to a certain value.
<br>- Variables should be ideally not too long and be in letters only.
<br>
<br>INC [variable name, number]
<br>- Increments a variable by a certain amount. (Use negative numbers to decrement)
<br>- see VAR for more info.
<br>
<br>GET [variable name]
<br>- Prints out the current value of a variable. Mainly used for debugging purposes.
<br>
<br>ASK [variable]
<br>- Opens a prompt for the user to enter a function.
<br>- Alternatively, you could type !stop to stop auto iterate if it's on.
<br>
<br>DEF [function name]
<br>- Defines a function.
<br>- Functions calling to other functions will crash the webpage.
<br>
<br>CALL [function name]
<br>- Defines a function.
<br>- Calling to other functions will crash the webpage.
<br>
<br>ASKFUNCTION [function name]
<br>- Opens a prompt for the user to enter a function.
<br>- Calling to other functions will crash the webpage.
<br>
<br>IF [number] [comparison] [number]
<br>- If the comparison is true, the nearest sequence preceded by a THEN is executed.
<br>
<br>UNLESS [number] [comparison] [number]
<br>- If the comparison is false, the nearest sequence preceded by a THEN is executed.
<br>
<br>REPEAT [number]
<br>- Repeats the nearest sequence preceded by a THEN is executed.
<br>
<br>*Currently, IF, UNLESS, and REPEAT statements cannot be nested.
<br>
<br>THEN (statement)
<br>- Searches for the nearest IF, UNLESS, or REPEAT, and does stuff accordingly.
<br>
<br>PRINT [text]
<br>- Prints text.
<br>
<br>PRINTMAFS [number]
<br>- Prints a number.
<br>
<br>WAIT [number]
<br>- Waits for that amount of milliseconds. Currently very buggy.
<br>
<br>POINTER 
<br>- Controls various aspects about the pointer
<br>	- POINTER ON: Turns pointer on
<br>	- POINTER OFF: Turns pointer off
<br>  - POINTER TOGGLE: Toggles pointer
