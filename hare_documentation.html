<br>HARE DOCUMENTATION:
<br>
<br>Info ya need to know beforehand:
<br>- Press RUN to iterate a program. Pressing RUN will not reset any values.
<br>- Press RESET to actually reset values.
<br>- All sequences end with a period (.) or a semicolon (;).
<br>- You can have multiple functions within a sequence. This could come in useful when dealing with INIT or IF/REPEAT/UNLESS keywords.
<br>	- Ex. PEN DOWN MOVE 10 TURN 15 PEN UP.
<br>- Numbers can be either numbers, variables, or expressions (any expression in JS will work as of now, will likely change this soon)
<br>- All variables are floating point
<br>- The canvas is 256 x 256
<br>- Pointer location can be accessed with px and py
<br>- You do not need to have quotation marks when inputting strings or variable names.
<br>- Calling a variable as part of an expression or IF statement sometimes crashes the app
<br>
<br><h1>VARIABLES</h1>
<br>
<br>func-ct: number of words in text
<br>px: pen x position
<br>py: pen y position
<br>pd: pen angle (in degrees)
<br>
<br><h1>FUNCTIONS</h1>
<br>
<br>INIT (sequence)
<br>- Any sequence with an INIT before it will only run on the first iteration.
<br>
<br>MOVE [number]
<br>- Moves the pointer by that amount of pixels.
<br>
<br>TURN [number in degrees]
<br>- Turns the pointer by that many degrees.
<br>
<br>PEN
<br>- Controls various aspects about the pen
<br>	- PEN UP: Stops drawing
<br>	- PEN DOWN: Starts drawing
<br>  - PEN TOGGLE: Toggles between pen up and down
<br>	- PEN [number] adjusts width of pen
<br>
<br>GOTO [x, y]
<br>- Goes to a point defined by the coordinates
<br>
<br>ANGLE [number in degrees]
<br>- Orients the pointer to a fixed rotation in degrees.
<br>
<br>RESET
<br>- Restarts the program. Sets iterations to 0 and reinitializes all values.
<br>
<br>CLEAR
<br>- Clears the screen.
<br>
<br>VAR [variable name, number]
<br>- Defines a variable, or sets it to a certain value.
<br>- Variables should be ideally not too long and be in letters only.
<br>
<br>INC [variable name, number]
<br>- Increments a variable by a certain amount. (Use negative numbers to decrement)
<br>- see VAR for more info.
<br>
<br>GET [variable name]
<br>- Prints out the current value of a variable. Mainly used for debugging purposes.
<br>
<br>HELP
<br>- Does nothing, since asking for help is bad for the environment as we all know
<br>
<br>IF [number] [comparison] [number]
<br>- If the comparison is true, the nearest sequence preceded by a THEN is executed.
<br>
<br>UNLESS [number] [comparison] [number]
<br>- If the comparison is false, the nearest sequence preceded by a THEN is executed.
<br>
<br>REPEAT [number]
<br>- Repeats the nearest sequence preceded by a THEN is executed.
<br>
<br>*Currently, IF, UNLESS, and REPEAT statements cannot be nested.
<br>
<br>THEN (statement)
<br>- Searches for the nearest IF, UNLESS, or REPEAT, and does stuff accordingly.
<br>
<br>PRINT [text]
<br>- Prints text.
<br>
<br>PRINTMAFS [number]
<br>- Prints a number.
<br>
<br>WAIT [number]
<br>- Waits for that amount of milliseconds. Currently very buggy.
<br>
<br>ASK [variable name]
<br>- Opens a popup asking for a variable value
<br>- Type "please stop" to stop program
<br>
<br>POINTER 
<br>- Controls various aspects about the pointer
<br>	- POINTER ON: Turns pointer on
<br>	- POINTER OFF: Turns pointer off
<br>  - PEN TOGGLE: Toggles pointer
